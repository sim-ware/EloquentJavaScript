# Eloquent JavaScript | Summarized

## Background
* book lying on shelf for ages
* felt too advanced as beginner
* after programming since 2015, 2018 professionally, felt like enough ground covered with JavaScript to be able to take on the book
* as well, the release of Deno's compatibility with Jupyter felt like a no-brainer to combine the two to streamline my learning experience
* programming books were always intimidating when a beginner, and then when I was programming professionally, creation and experimentation always felt like a more fluent learning approach. 
* reading about programming after a hard day's programming felt like overkill - especially if I had a good day
* h/e after a break from the industry
* as I become more conscious of how screens accelerate my thought, I have a love of reading, and by combining the pace of literacy with the concepts and tools I've been using professionally I hope to plug some knowledge gaps in those unknown unknowns and hopefully deepen the love and confidence in JavaScript.

## Approach
* each chapter will be summarized - it's eloquence converted to elegance (exaggerated simplicity), with accompanying notes & thoughts
* each exercise will be presented within a code box, with accompanying notes
* if anything beyond the Jupyter tooling is needed, accompanying instructions will be provided
* there is currently a 4th Edition of this book (link!). To compensate for the differences, I will take notes from this book, do the exercises from both, and do the extra chapters from the 4th Edition.

## Tools
* Deno
* Jupyter
* VSCode Jupyter Extension

## Setup Commands
* `curl -fsSL https://deno.land/install.sh | sh` (install deno)
* `deno --version`                               (validate download)
* `brew install jupyterlab`                      (install jupyter)
* `deno jupyter --install`                       (install deno jupyter extension)
* `deno jupyter --unstable`                      (runs deno jupyter setup)
* `pip install -U ipykernel`                     (required for Run-by-Line & DeBugging)
