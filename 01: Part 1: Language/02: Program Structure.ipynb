    "# Program Structure\n",
    "### Expressions & Statements\n",
    "'A fragment of code that produces a value is called an `expression`.'\n",
    "\n",
    "'This shows part of the beauty of a language-based interface. Expressions can nest in a way very similar to the subsentences in human languages are nested - a subsentence can contain its own subsentences, and so on. This allows us to combine expressions to express arbitrarily complex computations.'\n",
    "\n",
    "'If an expression corresponds to a sentence fragment, a JavaScript `statement` corresponds to a full sentence in human language.'\n",
    "\n",
    "'A program is simply a list of statements.'\n",
    "\n",
    "'In some cases, JavaScript allows you to omit the semicolon at the end of a statement. In other cases, it has to be there, or the next line will be treated as part of the same statement. The rules for when it can be safely omitted are somewhat complex and error-prone. In this book, every statement that needs a semicolon will always be terminated by one. I recommend you do the same in your own programs, at least until you've learned more about the subtleties involved in leaving out semicolons.'\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variables\n",
    "'To catch and hold values, JavaScript provides a thing called a `variable`.'\n",
    "\n",
    "'Digits can also be part of variable names - `catch22` is a valid name - but the name cannot start with a digit.'\n",
    "\n",
    "'A variable name cannot include punctuation, except for the character `$` & `_`.'\n",
    "\n",
    "'You should imagine variables as tentacles.. They do not contain values, they grasp them.'\n",
    "\n",
    "'If you ask for the value of an empty variable, you'll get the value `undefined`.'\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Environment\n",
    "'The collection of variables and their values that ecist at a given time is called the `environment`.'\n",
    "\n",
    "'When a program starts up, this environment is not empty. It always contains variables that are part of the language standard.'\n",
    "\n",
    "'Most of the time, it has variables that provide ways to interact with the surrounding system.'\n",
    "\n",
    "'For example, in a browser, there are variables and functions to inspect and influence the currently loaded website and to read mouse and keyboard input.'\n",
    "\n",
    "### Functions\n",
    "'A functions is a piece of the program wrapped in a value - such values can be `applied` in order to run the wrapped program.'\n",
    "\n",
    "'Executing a function is called `invoking`, `calling`, or `appyling` it.'\n",
    "\n",
    "### The `console.log` Function\n",
    "'Though variable names cannot contain period charaters, `console.log` clearly has one. This is because `console.log` isn't a simple variable. It is acutally an expression that retreives the `log` property from the value held by the `console` variable.'\n",
    "\n",
    "### Return Values\n",
    "'When a function produces a value, it is said to `return` that value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prompt & Confirm\n",
    "'You can ask the User an OK/Cancel Question using `confirm()`.'\n",
    "\n",
    "'The `prompt` function can be used to ask open question.'\n",
    "\n",
    "### Control Flow\n",
    "'When your program contains more than one statement, the statements are executed, predictably, from top to bottom.'\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conditional Execution\n",
    "'Executing statements in a straight-line order isn't the only option we have. An alternative is conditional execution, where we choose between two different routes based on a boolean value.'\n",
    "\n",
    "### `while` & `do` loops\n",
    "'Looping control flow allows us to go back to some point in the program where we were before and repeaat it with out current program state.'\n",
    "\n",
    "'A statement starting with the keyword `while` creates a loop. `while` is followed by an expression in parentheses and then a statement, much like `if`. The loop then executes that statement as long as the expression produces a value that is `true` when converted to Boolean type.\n",
    "\n",
    "'A sequence of statements wrapped in braces (`{}`) is called a `block`.'\n",
    "\n",
    "'The `do` loop is a control structure similar to the `while` loop.'\n",
    "\n",
    "'It differs only on one point. a `do` loop always executes its body at least once, and it starts testing whether it should stop only after that first execution.'\n",
    "\n",
    "### Indenting Code\n",
    "'The role of indentation in code is to make the structure of the code stand out.'\n",
    "\n",
    "'In complex code, where new blocks are opened inside other blocks, it can become hard to see where one block ends and another begins.'\n",
    "\n",
    "'With proper indentation, the visual shape of a program correspondes to the shape of the blocks inside it.'\n",
    "\n",
    "### `for` Loops\n",
    "'The parentheses after a `for` keyword must contain two semicolons. The part before the first semicolon initialises the loop, usually by defining a variable. The second part is the expression that checks whether the loop must continue. The final part updates the state of the loop after every iteration.'\n",
    "\n",
    "'In most cases, this is shorter and clearer than a `while` construct.'\n",
    "\n",
    "### Breaking Out of a Loop\n",
    "'Having the loop's condition produce `false` is not the only way a loop can finish. There is a special staement called `break` that has the effect of immediately jumping out of the enclosing loop.'\n",
    "\n",
    "'[In certain programs] if you were to leave out the `break` statement, or accidentally write a function that always produces `true`, your program would get stuck in an infinite loop.'\n",
    "\n",
    "'The `continue` keyword is similar to `break` in that it influences the progress of a loop. When `continue` is encountered in a loop body, control jumps out of the body and continues with the loop's next iteration.'\n",
    "\n",
    "### Updating Variables Succintly\n",
    "'JavaScript provides a shortcut for `counter = counter + 1`. It is `counter += 1`.'\n",
    "\n",
    "'Similar shortcuts work for many other operators, such as `results *= 2` to double `results` or `counter -= 1` to count downward.'\n",
    "\n",
    "'For `counter += 1` & `counter -= 1`, there are even shorter equivalents: `counter++` and `counter--`.'\n",
    "\n",
    "### Capitalisation e.g. `fuzzyLittleTurtle`\n",
    "'The standard JavaScript functions, and most programmers, follow the titled style when naming functions.'\n",
    "\n",
    "'In a few cases, such as the `Number` function, the first letter of a variable is also capitalised, to mark the function as a constructor.'"
