    "# Higher-Order Functions\n",
    "'A large program is a costly program, and not just because of the time it takes to build. Size almsot always involves complexity, and complexity confuses programmers. Confused programmers, in turn, tend to introduce mistakes into programs. A large program also provides a lot of space for these bugs to hide, making them hard to find.'\n",
    "\n",
    "'If we count the size of the definitions of sum and range, the second program is also big - even bigger than the first. But still, I'd argue that it is more likely to be correct.'\n",
    "\n",
    "'It is more likely to be correct because the solution is expressed in a vocabulary that corresponds to the problem being solved. Summing a range of numbers isn't about loops and counters. It's about ranges and sums.'\n",
    "\n",
    "'Because they are expressing simpler concepts than the program as a whole, they are easier to get right.'\n",
    "\n",
    "### Abstraction\n",
    "'In the context of programming, these kinds of vocabularies are usually called abstractions. Abstractions hide details and give us the ability to talk about problems at a higher (or more abstract) level.'\n",
    "\n",
    "'When programming, we can't rely on all the words we need to be waiting for us in the dictionary. Thus you might fall into the pattern of the first recipe - work out the precise steps the computer has to perform, one by one, blind to the highler-level concepts they express.'\n",
    "\n",
    "'It has to become second nature for a programmer, to notice when a concept is begging to be abstracted into a new word.'\n",
    "\n",
    "### Abstracting Array Traversal\n",
    "'Often, you don't pass a predefined function to `forEach` but create a function value on the spot instead.'\n",
    "\n",
    "### Higher-Order Functions\n",
    "'Functions that operate on other functions, either by taking them as arguments or by returning them, are called higher-order functions.'\n",
    "\n",
    "'Higher order functions allow us to abstract over actions, not just values.'\n",
    "\n",
    "'Because the inner function lives inside the environment of the outer one, it can use n. The bodies of such inner functions can access the variables around them. They can play a role similar to the {} blocks used in regular loops and conditional statements. An important difference is that variables declared inside inner functions do not end up in the environment of the outer function. And that is usually a good thing.'\n",
    "\n",
    "### Passing Along Arguments\n",
    "'For these kinds of situations, JavaScript functions have an `apply` method. You pass it an array (or array-like object) of arguments, and it will call the function with those arguments.'\n",
    "\n",
    "### JSON\n",
    "'JSON is similar to JavaScript's way of writing array snd objects, with a few restrictions. All property names have to be surrounded by double quotes, and only simple data expressions are allowed - no function calls, variables, or anything that invovles actual computation. Comments are not allowed in JSON.'\n",
    "\n",
    "'JavaScript gives us functions, the JSON.stringify and JSON.parse, that convert data from and to this format. The first takes a JavaScript value and returns a JSON-encoded string. The second takes such a string and converts it to the value it encodes.'\n",
    "\n",
    "### Filtering an Array\n",
    "'Note how the filter function, rather than deleting elements from the existing array, builds up a new array with only the elements that pass the test. This function is pure. It does not modify the array it is given. Like forEach, filter is also a standard method on arrays.'\n",
    "\n",
    "### Transforming with map\n",
    "'The map method transforms an array by applying a function to all of its elements and building an new array from the returned values. The new array will have the same length as the input array, but its content will have been 'mapped' to a new form by the function.'\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summarizing with reduce\n",
    "'The higher-order operation that represents this pattern is called reduce, or sometimes fold. You can think of it as folding up the array, one element at a time.'\n",
    "\n",
    "'If your array contains at least one element, you are allowed to leave off the start argument. The method will take the first element of the array as its start value and start reducing at the second element.'\n",
    "\n",
    "### Composability\n",
    "'Higher-order functions start to shine when you need to compose functions.'\n",
    "\n",
    "'Instead of tangling the logic into a big loop, it is neatly composed into the concepts we are interested in - determining sex, computing age, and averaging numbers. We can apply these one by one to get the result we are looking for.'\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Cost\n",
    "'In the happy land of elegant code and pretty rainbows, there lives a spoilsport monster called inefficieny.'\n",
    "\n",
    "'Likewise, passing a function to forEach and letting that method handle the array iteration for us is convenient and easy to read. But function calls in JavaSCript are costly compared to simple loop bodies.'\n",
    "\n",
    "'Abstractions add layers between the raw things the computer is doing and the concepts we are working with a thus cause the machine to perform more work. This is not an iron law, but an issue that happens frequently.'"
