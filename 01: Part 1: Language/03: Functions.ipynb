    "# Functions\n",
    "'Functions are the bread and butter of JavaScript programming.'\n",
    "\n",
    "'The concept of wrapping a piece of program in a value has many uses.'\n",
    "\n",
    "'It is a tool to structure larger programs, to reduce repetition, to associate names with subprograms, and to isolate these subprograms from each other.'\n",
    "\n",
    "'The most obvious application of functions is defining new vocabulary. Creating new words in regular, human-language prose is usuall bad style. But in programming, it is indispensable.'\n",
    "\n",
    "'Typical adult English speakers have some 20,000 words in their vocabulary. Few programming languages come with 20,000 commands built in.'\n",
    "\n",
    "'The `return` keyword without an expression after it will cause the function to return `undefined`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parameters & Scopes\n",
    "'The parameters to a function behave like regular variables, but their initial values are given by the caller of the function, not the code in the function itself.'\n",
    "\n",
    "'By treating function-local variables as existing only within the function, the language makes it possible to read and understand functions as small universes, without having to worry about all the code at once.'\n",
    "\n",
    "### Nested Scopes\n",
    "'..in JavaScript functions are the only things that create a new scope.'\n",
    "\n",
    "'The `let` keyword works like `var` but creates a variables that is local to the enclosing block, not the enclosing function.'\n",
    "\n",
    "### Declaration Notation\n",
    "'This is a function declaration.'\n",
    "```\n",
    "function square(x) {\n",
    "  return x * x;\n",
    "};\n",
    "```\n",
    "'Function declarations are not part of the regular top-to-bottom flow of control. They are conceptually moved to the top of their scope and can be used by all the code in that scope.'\n",
    "\n",
    "'This is somestimes useful becuase it gives us the freedom to order code in a way that seems meaningful, without worrying about having to define all functions above their first use.'\n",
    "\n",
    "'If you want your programs to behave consistently, only use this form of function-defining statements in the outermost block of a function or program.'\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Call Stack\n",
    "'Because a function has to jump back to the place of the call when it returns, the computer must remember the context from which the function was called.'\n",
    "\n",
    "'The place where the computer stores this context is the call stack.'\n",
    "\n",
    "'Every time a function is called, the current context is put on top of this \"stack\".'\n",
    "\n",
    "'When the function returns, it removes the top context from the stack and uses it to continue execution.'\n",
    "\n",
    "'Storing this stack requires space in the computer's memory.'\n",
    "\n",
    "'When the stack grows too big, the computer will fail with a message like \"out of stack space\" or \"too much recursion\".'\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optional Arguments\n",
    "'The function `alert` officially only accepts one argument.'\n",
    "\n",
    "'[When called with more than one] it doesn't complain. It simply ignores the other arguments and shows you [the first].'\n",
    "\n",
    "'JavaScript is extremely broad-minded about the number of arguments you pass to a function. If you pass too many, the extra ones are ignored. If you pass too few, the missing parameters simply get assigned the value `undefined`.'\n",
    "\n",
    "'The downside of this is that it is possible, likely, even, that you'll accidentally pass the wrong number of arguments to functions and no one will tell you about it.'\n",
    "\n",
    "'The upside is that this behaviour can be used to have a function take \"optional arguments\".'\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recursion\n",
    "'It is prefectly okay for a function to call itself, as long as it takes care not to overflow the stack. A function that calls itself is called recursive.'\n",
    "\n",
    "'Recursion allows some functions to be written in a different style.'\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "function power (base, exponent) {\n",
    "  if (exponent === 0) {\n",
    "    return 1;\n",
    "  };\n",
    "  else {\n",
    "    return base * power(base, exponent - 1);\n",
    "  };\n",
    "};\n",
    "\n",
    "console.log(power(2,3));\n",
    "// > 8\n",
    "```\n",
    "'This is rather close to the way mathematicians define exponentation and arguably describes the concept ina  more elegant way than the looping variant does.'\n",
    "\n",
    "'The function calls itself mutliple times with different arguments to achieve the repeated multiplication.'\n",
    "\n",
    "'But this implementation has one important problem: in typical JavaScript implementations, it's about 10 times slower than the looping version. Running through a simple loop is a lot cheaper than calling a function multiple times.'\n",
    "\n",
    "'The dilemma of speed versus elegance is an interesting one. You can see it as a kind of continuum between human-friendliness and machine-friendliness.'\n",
    "\n",
    "'Almost any program can be made faster by making it bigger and more convoluted. The programmer must decide on an appropriate balance.'\n",
    "\n",
    "'THE BASIC RULE, WHICH HAS BEEN REPEATED BY MANY PROGRAMMERS AND WITH WHICH I WHOLEHEARTEDLY AGREE, IS TO NOT WORRY ABOUT EFFICIENCY UNTIL YOU KNOW FOR SURE THAT THE PROGRAM IS TOO SLOW. IF IT IS, FIND OUT WHICH PARTS ARE TAKING UP THE MOST TIME, AND START EXCHANGING ELEGANCE FOR EFFICIENCY IN THOSE PARTS.'\n",
    "\n",
    "'The reason we stress this is, suprisingly, many beginners focus fanatically on efficiency, even in the smallest details. The result is begger, more complicated, and often less correct programs, that take longer to write than their more straightforward equivalents and run only marginally faster.'\n",
    "\n",
    "### Growing Functions\n",
    "'There are two more or less natural ways for functions to be introduced into programs.'\n",
    "\n",
    "'The first is that you find yourself writing very similar code multiple times.'\n",
    "\n",
    "'The second is that you find you need some functionality that you haven't written yet and that sounds like it deserves its own function.'\n",
    "\n",
    "'How difficult it is to find a good name for a function is a good indication of how clear a concept it is that you're trying to wrap.'\n",
    "\n",
    "'A function with a nice, obvious name like `zeroPad` makes it easier for someone who reads the code to figure out what it does. And it is useful in more situations than just this specific program. For example, you could use it to help print nicely aligned tables of numbers.' \n",
    "\n",
    "'A useful principle is not to add cleverness unless you are absolutely sure you're going to need it.'\n",
    "\n",
    "### Functions & Side Effects\n",
    "'Functions can be roughly divided into those that are called for their side effects and those that are called for their return value.' (And you can have both in one function).\n",
    "\n",
    "'Functions that create values are easier to combine in new ways than functions that directly perform side effects.'\n",
    "\n",
    "'A pure function is a specific kind of value-producing function that not only has no side effects, but also doesn't rely on side effects from other code - for example, it doesn't read global variables that are occasionally changed by other code.'\n",
    "\n",
    "'A pure function has the pleasant property that, when called with the same arguments, it always produces the same value.'\n",
    "\n",
    "'Some operations are also easier to express when written in an efficient way when we use side effects, so somputing speed can be a reason to avoid purity.'"
