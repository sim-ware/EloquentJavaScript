    "# The Secret Life of Objects\n",
    "'One philosophy is that complexity can be managed by separating it inot small compartments that are isolated from each other. These compartments have ended up with the name objects.'\n",
    "\n",
    "'An Object is a hard shell that hides the gooey complexity insite it and instead offers us a few knobs and connectors (such as methods) that present an interface through which the object is to be used.'\n",
    "\n",
    "'The idea is that the interface is relatively simple and all the complex things going on inside the object can be ignored when working with it.'\n",
    "\n",
    "'These ideas were initially worked out in the 1970s and 1980s, and in the 90s, were carried up by a huge wave of hype - the object oriented programming revolution. Suddenly.. anything that did not involve objects was outdated nonsense.'\n",
    "\n",
    "'That kind of zealotry always produces a lot of impractical silliness, and there has been a sort of counter-revolution since then.'\n",
    "\n",
    "'There are several useful concepts, most importantly that of encapsulation (distinguishing between internal complexity and external) that the object-oriented culture has popularised.'\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methods\n",
    "'Methods are simply properties that hold function values.'\n",
    "\n",
    "'When a function is called as a method - looked up as property and immediately called, as in object.method() - the special variable this in its body will point to the object that it was called on.'\n",
    "\n",
    "'Recall that the apply and bind method both take a first argument that can be used to simulate method calls. This first argument is in fact used to give a value to this.'\n",
    "\n",
    "'There is a method similar to apply, called 'call'. It also calls the function its is a method of but takes its arguments normall, rather than as an array.'\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constructors\n",
    "'A more convenient way to create objects that derive from some shared prototype is to use a constructor. In JavaScript, calling a function with the new keyword in front of it causes it to be treated as a constructor. The constructor will have its this variable bound to a fresh object, and unless it explicitly returns another object value, this new object will be returned from the call.'\n",
    "\n",
    "'An object created with new is said to be an instance of its constructor.'\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prototype Interface\n",
    "'A prototype can be used at any time to add new properties and methods to all objects based on it.'\n",
    "\n",
    "'That's convenient. But there are situations where it causes problems.'\n",
    "\n",
    "### Polymorphism\n",
    "'When a piece of code is written to work with object that have a certain interface - in this case, a toString method - any kind of object that happens to support this interface can be plugged into the code, and it will just work.'\n",
    "\n",
    "'This technique is called polymorphism - though no actual shapeshifting is involved. Polymorphic code can work with values of different shapes, as long as they support the interface it expects.'\n",
    "\n",
    "'Using a variable name starting with an underscore (_) or consisting entirely of a single underscore is a way to indicate (to human readers) that this argument is not going to be used.'\n",
    "\n",
    "### Getters & Setters\n",
    "'This has led some people to adopt a principle of never including non-method properties in interfaces. Rather than directly access a simple value property, they'd use `getSomething` and `setSomething` methods to read and write the property. This approach has the downside that you will end up writing - and reading - a lot of additional methods.'\n",
    "\n",
    "'In object literal, the get or set notation for properties allows you to specify a function to be run when the property is read or written.'\n",
    "\n",
    "'You can also add such a property to an existing object, for example a protottype, using the Object.defineProperty function.'\n",
    "\n",
    "'You can use a similar set property, in the object passed to defineProperty, to specify a setter method. When a getter but no setter is defined, writing to the property is simply ignored.'\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inheritance\n",
    "'Prototypes may themselves have prototypes.'\n",
    "\n",
    "'Inheritance allows us to build slightly different data types from existing data types with relatively little work. Typically, the new constructor will call the old constructor.'\n",
    "\n",
    "'Inheritance is a fundamental part of the object-oreinted tradition, alongside encapsulation and ploymorphism. But while the latter two are now generally regarded as wonderful ideas, inheritance is somewhat controversial.'\n",
    "\n",
    "'Whereas encapsulation and polymorphism can be used to separate pieces of code from each other, reducing the tangledness of the overall program, inheritance fundamentally ties types together, creating more tangle.'\n",
    "\n",
    "### The instanceof Operator\n",
    "'It is occasionally useful to know whether an object was derived from a specific constructor. For this, JavaScript provides a binary operator called instanceof.'\n",
    "\n",
    "'The operator will see through inherited types.'\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "'One useful thing to do with object is to specify an interface for them and tell everybody that they are supposed to talk to your object only through that interface. The rest of the details that make up your object are now encapsulated, hidden behind the interface.'\n",
    "\n",
    "'Having different object expose the same interface and then writing code that works on any object with the interface is called polymorphism.'"
