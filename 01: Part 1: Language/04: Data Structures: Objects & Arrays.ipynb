    "# Objects & Arrays\n",
    "'Objects allow us to group values - including other objects - together and thus build more complex structures.'\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Sets\n",
    "'Fortunately, JavaScript provides a data type specifically for storing sequences of values. It is called an array and is written as a list of values between square brackets, separated by commas.'\n",
    "\n",
    "### Properties\n",
    "'Almost all JavaScript values have properties. The exceptions are `null` and `undefined`. If you try to access a property on one of these nonvalues, you get an error.'\n",
    "\n",
    "'The two most common ways to access properties in JavaScript are with a dot and with square brackets. Both value.x and value[x] access a property on value - but not necessarily the same property.'\n",
    "\n",
    "'When using square brackets, the expression between the brackets is evaluated to get the property name.'\n",
    "\n",
    "'Whereas value.x fetches the property of the value named 'x', value[x] tries to evaluate the expression x and uses the result as the property name.'\n",
    "\n",
    "'The elements in an array are stored in properties. Becuase the names of these properties are number and we often need to get their name from a variable, we have to use the bracket syntax to access them.'\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methods\n",
    "'Both string and array pbjects contain, in addition to the length property, a number of properties that refer to function values.'\n",
    "\n",
    "'Properties that contain functions are generally called methods of the value they belong to. As in, \"toUpperCase is a method of a string.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objects\n",
    "'Values of the type object are arbitrary collections of properties, and we can add or remove these properties as we please. One way to create an object is by using a brace notation.'\n",
    "\n",
    "'Spaces and line breaks are not significant. When an object spans multiple lines, indenting it like in the previous example improves readability. Properties whose names are not valid variable names or valid numbers have to be quoted.'\n",
    "\n",
    "'This means that braces have 2 meanings in JavaScript. At the start of a statement, they start a block of statements. In any other position, they describe an object.'\n",
    "\n",
    "'Reading amproperty that doesn't exist will produce the value undefined.'\n",
    "\n",
    "'Property bindings grasp values, but other variables and properties may be holding onto those same values. You may think of objects as octopuses with any number of tentacles, each of which has a name inscribed on it.'\n",
    "\n",
    "'The delete operator cuts off a tentacle from such an octopus. It is a unary operator that, when applied to a property access expression, will remove the named property from the object.'\n",
    "\n",
    "'The binary in operator, when applied to a string and an object, returns a Boolean value that indicates whether that object has that property.'\n",
    "\n",
    "'Arrays then, are just a kind of object specialised for storing sequences of things'.\n",
    "\n",
    "'JavaScript's == operator, when comparing objects, will return true only if both objects are precisely the same value.'\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objects as Maps\n",
    "'A map is a way to go from values in one domain to corresponding values in another domain.'\n",
    "\n",
    "'JavaScript provides a loop construct specifically for going over the properties of an object; `for...in..`.'\n",
    "\n",
    "### Further Arrayology\n",
    "'We saw push and pop, which ass and remove elements at the end of an array, earlier in this chapter. The corresponding methods for adding and removing things at the start of an array are called unshift and shift.'\n",
    "\n",
    "'The indexOf method has a sibling called lastIndexof, which starts searching for the given element at the nedof the array instead of the front.'\n",
    "\n",
    "'Both indexOf and lastIndexOf take an optional second argument that indicates where to start searching from.'\n",
    "\n",
    "'Another fundamental method is slice, which takes a start index and an end index and returns an array containing only the elements between the indices.'\n",
    "\n",
    "'The start index is inclusive, the end index is excelusive.'\n",
    "\n",
    "'Strings also have a slice method, which has a similar effect.'\n",
    "\n",
    "'The concat method can be used to glue array together, similar to what the + operator does for strings.'\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strings & Their Properties\n",
    "'We can read properties like length and toUpperCase from string values, but if your try to add a new property, it doesn't stick.'\n",
    "\n",
    "'Values of type string, number and Boolean are not objects, and though the language doesn't complain if you try to set new properties on them, it doesn't actually store those properties. The values are immutable and cannot be changed.'\n",
    "\n",
    "### The arguments Object\n",
    "'Whenever a function is called, a special variable named arguments is added to the environment in which the function body runs. This variable refers to an object that holds all of the arguments passed to the function.'\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Math Object\n",
    "\n",
    "'The Math object is used simply as a container to group a bunch of related functionality. There is only one Math object, and it is almost never useful as a value. Rather, it provides a namespace so that all these functions and values do not have to be global variables.'\n",
    "\n",
    "'Having too many global variables \"pollutes\" the namespace. The more names that have been taken, the more likely you are to accidentally overwrite the value of some variable.'\n",
    "\n",
    "'Many language will stop you, or at least warn you, when you are defining a variable with a name that is already taken. JavaScript does neither, so be careful.'\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Global Object\n",
    "'The global scope, the space in which global variables live, can be also be approached as an object in JavaScript. Each global variable is present as a property of this object. In browsers, the global scope object is stored in the window variable.'"
